\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{cpt:ack}

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Konrad Tywoniuk, Researcher at the University of Bergen, for excellent guidance throughout these last two semesters. I was always welcome to ask for help, and Konrad would never hesitate to go through long and tedious derivations in order to explain a particular concept. Without Konrad's guidance, this thesis would not have been possible, and I am grateful for all that I have learned from him during this process.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the heavy-ion group for interesting seminars and journal clubs over the last two years. Thanks should also go to Adam Takacs, Ph.D. Candidate, for teaching me about the Sudakov form factor.

I would like to extend sincere thanks to my fellow master's students for partaking in this journey. In particular, Mathias and Sigurd for fruitful discussions, sharing a reading room, and consistently allowing me to prod their shoulders whenever I have had questions. 

Finally, I would like to give a special thank you to Silje, for always reminding me of the world outside of theoretical physics.

\chapter*{Abstract}\label{cpt:abst}
Jets are created in the aftermath of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the fragmentation of jets in proton-proton collisions is well known, there is still a lot to learn about jet fragmentation in heavy-ion collisions. Usually, one studies the inclusive fragmentation properties of the shower. However, studying the properties of the leading (or most energetic) particle in the jet might bring a deeper understanding of jet-quenching and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma.

The motivation for the thesis is to investigate the leading parton distribution and describe it analytically. The analytical formalism of the inclusive distribution is presented, for both vacuum and medium, and the evolution equations are solved. In parallel, Monte-Carlo programs are developed for simulating parton showers in both vacuum and medium, and the results are compared with the analytical solutions. 

The current formulation of leading parton energy-loss assumes soft radiation and is inaccurate for substantial energy-loss. It would therefore be interesting to formulate evolution equations for the leading parton. The proposed evolution equation is valid for on-branch gluons in vacuum and a solution is obtained in Mellin space.

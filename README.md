## Master Thesis in Theoretical Atomic, Nuclear and Particle Physics. Kristoffer Skjelanger, University of Bergen.

### GitHub overview
The Main branch is the latest functioning version of the collective parton showers and spltting function programs.
New features are created on the develop Branch, and merged with Master when functioning and running. 
The Latex documents which represent the thesis itself, is written to the branch Latex. Compilation is done in Overleaf with LuaLaTex. 

### Abstract 
Jets are created in the aftermath of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the inclusive parton
distribution of jets is well known, there is still a lot to learn about the leading parton distribution.
The motivation for this thesis is to investigate how the leading parton distribution behaves, and
whether it can be described and solved analytically. The analytical formalism of the inclusive
distribution is presented, for both vacuum and medium, and the evolution equations are solved.
In parallel, Monte-Carlo programs are created for simulating parton showers in both vacuum
and medium. The analytical solutions of the evolution equations are then used to validate the
Monte-Carlo results.
The current formulation of leading parton energy-loss assumes soft radiation and is inaccurate
for substantial energy-loss. It would then be interesting to apply the knowledge of the inclusive
distribution, to formulate evolution equations for the leading parton. The proposed evolution
equations are solved for gluons in vacuum, where the solution is obtained in Mellin-space.
